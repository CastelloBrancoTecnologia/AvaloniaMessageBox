- Single view apps (`ISingleViewApplicationLifetime`)
- Early fallback before `MainWindow` or `MainView` is ready
- DPI-aware sizing and theme-aware font and styling
- Optional icons and multi-line messages
- Modal behavior even in SingleView via panel overlay

## ‚ú® Features

- Compatible with .NET 9 and Avalonia 11.2+
- Uses theme fonts and colors
- Supports `OK`, `OK/Cancel`, and `Yes/No` button sets
- Icons: Info, Warning, Error, Success, Question, Stop
- Automatically adapts to application lifetime and environment

## üöÄ Usage

```csharp
await AvaloniaWindowedMessageBox.ShowAsync(
    parent: this, // Can be a Window or UserControl
    title: "Attention",
    message: "Are you sure you want to continue?",
    buttons: AvaloniaWindowedMessageBox.MessageBoxButtons.YesNo,
    icon: AvaloniaWindowedMessageBox.MessageBoxIcon.Question);
```

You can call it even before setting `MainWindow` in your `App.cs`:
